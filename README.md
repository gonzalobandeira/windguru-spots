A React Native application built with Expo that allows users to check their preferred sailing/surf spots in one place using Windguru forecasts.

## Features

- View Windguru forecasts for your favorite sailing/surf spots
- Organize spots into custom groups
- Drag and drop to reorder spots and groups
- Add new locations with custom names and Windguru spot IDs
- Choose from different forecast models
- Delete locations and groups
- Export and import your spots and groups
- Cross-platform support for iOS and Android (on the roadmap)
