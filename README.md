# Windguru Spots

A React Native application built with Expo that allows users to check their preferred sailing/surf spots in one place using Windguru forecasts. This app is designed for sailors and surfers who want to quickly check conditions at their favorite spots without having to visit multiple websites or remember different spot IDs.

## Features

- View Windguru forecasts for your favorite sailing/surf spots
- Organize spots into custom groups
- Drag and drop to reorder spots and groups
- Add new locations with custom names and Windguru spot IDs
- Choose from different forecast models
- Delete locations and groups
- Export and import your spots and groups
- Cross-platform support for iOS and Android (on the roadmap)

2. Each spot shows a Windguru forecast widget
3. Pull to refresh to update forecasts
4. Tap on a group to expand/collapse it

### Exporting and Importing
